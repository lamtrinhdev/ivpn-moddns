                                            modDNS is developed and operated by the team behind IVPN. All services we offer to customers are built for privacy. Internally, we know what exactly that means. If a choice needs to be made between one practice that deepens a user's privacy, and another that would diminish it but accelerate our growth, we'll always take the slower, more private option.
